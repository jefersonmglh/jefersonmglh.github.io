### [Development and application of artificial intelligence techniques to estimate the level of influence of socioeconomic factors on the performance of ENEM 2021 candidates](https://github.com/jefersonmglh/analise_enem_projeto_semantix/){:target="_blank"}
<br> This report analyzes the impact of socioeconomic factors on ENEM 2021 candidate's performance using predictive analysis. The results showed that the neural network model outperformed others techniques, assessed by metrics like RÂ² and Mean Squared Error. Exploring candidates' socioeconomic characteristics, family income emerged as the most influential factor, followed by the presence of a computer at home and the number of people living with the candidate.

### [Prediction of the carbonation front in concrete structures using machine learning](https://github.com/jefersonmglh/analise_enem_projeto_semantix/){:target="_blank"}
<br>The depth of the carbonation front in concrete increases over time due to the ingress and reaction of CO2, but slows down as calcium carbonate partially blocks the pores.

### [Formula 1 Data Analyses](https://github.com/jefersonmglh/Formula-1_historial_analysis){:target="_blank"}
<br>This project encompasses two main aspects: the analysis of Formula 1 history and the analysis of each Grand Prix. In the first part, we identified the most successful drivers and prominent constructor teams throughout the history of Formula 1. In the second part, we conducted a detailed analysis of each Grand Prix, including practice sessions, qualifying, and the race itself. This analysis delves into aspects such as speeds, lap times, car and driver performance, and some peculiarities of the track. Additionally, the study and improvement of techniques for manipulating dataframes and creating graphs were of great importance in this project. <br>
