### [Predictive Modeling for Horse Racing Performance Analysis](https://jefersonmglh.github.io/){:target="_blank"}
<br>In this project, we employed advanced data science techniques to analyze horse racing performance and predict race outcomes. After collecting and preprocessing raw data from various racing events, including feature engineering and normalization, we developed three neural network models using TensorFlow, alongside XGBoost classifiers and linear regression models. These models were rigorously evaluated for accuracy and performance metrics, and the most promising ones were deployed for real-time or batch predictions, offering valuable insights into horse racing dynamics and strategies.<br>

### [Development and application of artificial intelligence techniques to estimate the level of influence of socioeconomic factors on the performance of ENEM 2021 candidates](https://github.com/jefersonmglh/analise_enem_projeto_semantix/){:target="_blank"}
<br> This report analyzes the impact of socioeconomic factors on ENEM 2021 candidate's performance using predictive analysis. The results showed that the neural network model outperformed others techniques, assessed by metrics like RÂ² and Mean Squared Error. Exploring candidates' socioeconomic characteristics, family income emerged as the most influential factor, followed by the presence of a computer at home and the number of people living with the candidate.<br>

### [Prediction of the carbonation front in concrete structures using artificial neural network](https://github.com/jefersonmglh/analise_enem_projeto_semantix/){:target="_blank"}
<br>This 'Freelancer' work was conducted for a PhD project at the Federal University of Goias, with a focus on studying the depth of the carbonation front in concrete over time. To address this, a neural network model, specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, was constructed. The model incorporated both internal variables (related to the concrete's age and composition) and external variables (related to the concrete's exposure conditions, such as climate). Statistical analysis was employed to accurately determine these external variables. Given the temporal nature of the data, the model was developed as a timeseries neural network to effectively capture the relationship with time.<br>

### [Formula 1 Data Analyses](https://github.com/jefersonmglh/Formula-1_historial_analysis){:target="_blank"}
<br>This project encompasses two main aspects: the analysis of Formula 1 history [(Repository)](https://github.com/jefersonmglh/Formula-1_historial_analysis){:target="_blank"} and the 2023 Season's analyses of each Grand Prix [(Repository)](https://github.com/jefersonmglh/Formula-1_2023_season_analyses){:target="_blank"}. In the first part, we identified the most successful drivers and prominent constructor teams throughout the history of Formula 1. In the second part, we conducted a detailed analysis of each Grand Prix, including practice sessions, qualifying, and the race itself. This analysis delves into aspects such as speeds, lap times, car and driver performance, and some peculiarities of the track. Additionally, the study and improvement of techniques for manipulating dataframes and creating graphs were of great importance in this project. <br>

### [Credit Analysis: Predicting Default with Machine Learning](https://github.com/jefersonmglh/analise-credito){:target="_blank"}
<br>This project focused on credit analysis, utilizing a dataset containing information about individuals and a target variable (default) indicating whether the person is a good or bad payer. The project involved extensive exploratory data analysis and data preprocessing. Various predictive models, including Naive Bayes and decision tree, were applied. The decision tree model outperformed others, achieving an accuracy of 0.83.
